================

We are Andrew Cholakian and Daniel Greenfeld, two developer/entrepreneurs who live and work in the Los Angeles area. 

Background
----------

I read <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Tom Preston-Werner's blog post</a> about how he developed Jekyll in order to store his writing in a Git repo, just like code.

I love the idea of this.

I should break this blog post into two at some point, or at least delete the following sections.  But right now I'm just playing around with it.
